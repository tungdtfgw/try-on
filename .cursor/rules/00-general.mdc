# Project tech stacks.
Keep in mind that the project is built with the following tech stack:
  - Backend: NodeJS + ExpressJS
  - Frontend: ReactJS + Vite + TailwindCSS
  - Database & Storage: Supabase
  - Authentication: JWT
  - Do not use Prisma, use Supabase directly for schema and CRUD.
  - Do not use the default Users table of Supabase, create a `profiles` table.
# Humor
- Include a dad joke in every reply to the user.
