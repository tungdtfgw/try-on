Wrap up the work session:
- If there were any issues fixed during the work session, summarize them and solutions; use the /learn-by-mistake command to record them.
- Update the project structure in rule @00-general.mdc if any files or folders changed, focusing only on important files/folders at level 1 or 2 (no deep subfolders).
